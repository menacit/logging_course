For detailed notes, glossary, labs and similar, see:

<!--
- There are several resources to help you learn

- Speaker notes in slides are heavily recommended for recaps/deep diving

- May also be available through LMS, depending on how the course is consumed

- The course is designed to be instructor lead, won't make the most of it on your own, see as aid

- Presentations may be recorded, but only the speaker side for good and bad
